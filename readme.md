Usual Workflow Guide
--------------------

1. Before starting to work, execute `git remote update` to fetch changes from `origin`.
2. Either continue working on your current branch or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
   * Creating a new branch can be done with `git branch labX-assignmentY` (for some `X` and `Y`).
   * Change your branch from `master` to your new one with `git checkout labX-assignmentY`.
3. Work. Work. Work. When you are happy, you should commit and push your changes upstream.
   * Add the changes you made to the staging area with `git add -A`, as usual.
   * Commit the changes with `git commit -m "Some nice feature"`, as usual.
   * Publish your changes to the remote repository `git push origin labX-assignmentY`.
4. Now, continue working and doing (1-3) over and over again until the task is done.
5. Finally, go to GitHub repository page, press `New Pull Request` and select your branch.
6. Wait for comments from the other group members. Thereafter, press `Merge` to `master`.
7. You are now done! If you want, delete the current branch (in GitHub). Go back to (1)!
