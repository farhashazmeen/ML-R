    \section*{Assignment 1}

        In this assignment we are tasked with predicting the sex of Australian Crabs given their carapace length and the rear width. For this purpose we will be using
        Linear Discriminant Analyis (LDA) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation for predicting the unknown classification parameters. The first step involves plotting the
        data in order to determine if the data would be linearly separable into different categories (male and female in this case). This plot can be found in below in
        Figure~\ref{fig:crabs}.

        \begin{figure}
          \centering
          \caption{Sex Classification of Australian Crabs}
          \label{fig:crabs}
          \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{share/crabs.eps}
        \end{figure}

        Our next task is to visualize the decision boundary between the different classifications. Since this is not already implemented by a package in R, we have to
        develop our own LDA method. A LDA can be implemented by comparing Linear Discriminant Functions (LDF) with each other, one for each corresponding class. In practice
        this means, since LDF is implemented with a likelihood function, one can assume that by applying predictor features to the function, the result would yield some indication
        of how likely this observation can be classified as the label corresponding to that LDF. An LDF can be described in the following way:

        \begin{equation} \label{eq:lda}
          \begin{split}
            \delta_k(x) &=  w_1 - b_1 \\
            w_1 &= x^{T}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k, \\
            b_1 &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_k^{T}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k+log\pi_k
          \end{split}
        \end{equation}

        After calculating the parameters for both labels (male and female) using the Equation~\ref{eq:lda} above, we can find the intercept and slope of the decision boundary
        separating both of these classes. This is done by simply subtracting each coefficient from each other, thereafter plotting this in Figure~\ref{fig:boundary}. Intuitively this
        is a short method of comparing likelihood of classes given feature predictors.
